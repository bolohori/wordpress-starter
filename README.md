# WordPress starter
A starter template for WordPress websites featuring [Docker](https://www.docker.com), Gulp and Webpack.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js -> 8.0.0
* Yarn -> 1.0.0
* Composer -> 1.5.1
* Docker -> 17.12
  * docker-compose -> 1.16.1

### Setup
**Step 1:** First rename the `app/wp-content/themes/md-starter-theme` folder using your **`theme-name`**.

**Step 2:** Then rename every occurrence of `md-starter-theme` in the entire parent folder (except in `./README.md`) using your **`theme-name`**.

**Step 3:** You can now edit all informations related to your theme in [`app/wp-content/themes/[theme-name]/style.css`](https://github.com/wearemd/wordpress-starter/blob/master/app/wp-content/themes/md-starter-theme/style.css):

```css
/**
 * Theme Name: MD starter theme
 * Author: MD
 * Author URI: https://wearemd.com
 * Version: 1.0.0
 */

```

**Step 4:** Finally run `make setup` to get everything ready: Docker containers, WordPress download and configuration (Fr by default, you can change this in [`Makefile` (line 17)](https://github.com/wearemd/wordpress-starter/blob/master/Makefile#L17)), etc.

Your WordPress is ready to be themed, well done fella (yes, there is nothing else to do) üëä

### Serve
`make`
* Start WordPress on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with livereload
* Start phpMyAdmin on [localhost:3011](http://localhost:3011)
* Make WordPress back-office accessible at [localhost:3010/wp-admin](http://localhost:3010/wp-admin)
  * Username: `admin`
  * Password: `password`

### Build
`make build_assets`: Build theme assets for production

## Versioning
‚ö†Ô∏è When you update the WordPress theme, don‚Äôt forget to **change the theme version number** in [`app/wp-content/themes/md-starter-theme/style.css` (line 5)](https://github.com/wearemd/wordpress-starter/blob/master/app/wp-content/themes/md-starter-theme/style.css#L5) before deploying. This version number will append to CSS/JS files to avoid browser cache on those assets.

## Folders
* `app/wp-content/themes/md-starter-theme`: Your new WordPress theme
* `gulp`: Gulp tasks and configuration
* `sass`: Theme Sass files (edit those files to update your theme CSS)
  * This theme is built using [Bulma modular CSS framework](https://bulma.io)
